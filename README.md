# React, Redux & Sass Starter
A simple and quick way to get you going with developing React applications with Redux and Sass for styling. Comes with pre-configured Webpack for bundling your application.

**Demo:** https://www.gigacore.in/demos/react-redux-demo/

### Components ðŸ”© Styles ðŸŽ¨ Action! ðŸŽ¬

With all neccessary tools in place, all you need to do is start creating React Components, style them and optionally use Redux for the State management. It is recommended to use Redux if you are building applications that require interactions between multiple components or that requires pulling data from external source.

All the required code (JS + Sass) goes inside the ```src``` folder. Webpack will compile, bundle and output in the ```public``` folder, which you can upload / deploy to the root directory of your web server to publish your app!
